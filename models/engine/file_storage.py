class FileStorage:
    """
    This serves as the storage engine for the AirBnB web application,
    ensuring data persistence. It empowers us to convert the dictionary
    representation of objects into a JSON string through serialization.
    Additionally, it allows us to recreate instances of our BaseModel by
    deserializing JSON strings stored in a persistent file.

    Class Attributes:

        __file_path (str): The path to the JSON file (e.g., file.json).
        __objects (dict): An empty dictionary that stores all objects using
                        a format like <class name>.id (e.g., for a BaseModel
                        object with id=12121212, the key will be
                        BaseModel.12121212).
    Class Methods:

        all: Returns the dictionary __objects.
        new: Adds an object to __objects, using the key <obj class name>.id.
        save: Serializes the __objects dictionary and saves it to a JSON file.
        reload: Deserializes the JSON file and loads data back into the
        __objects dictionary
